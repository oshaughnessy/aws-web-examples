Ways to host web sites at AWS

## Requirements

The examples here will require you to have an [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/)
account. Most require the [Python BOTO](https://aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-python/)
library.

To try these examples, you'll need [AWS API](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/a-new-and-standardized-way-to-manage-credentials-in-the-aws-sdks/)
credentials set up.
